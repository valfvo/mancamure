                The board game is made of 2x6 pits with 4 seeds in each pits and 
                2 banks in each side. The 6 lower pits and the right bank are 
                yours.
                <br><br>
                Click on one pit to sow its seeds in the following pits. 
                Distribution is counterclockwise.
                <br><br>
                <b>Collection :</b> If the last sowed seed lands on a opponent pit
                with 1 or 2 seeds, the player collects the 2 or 3 seeds and 
                deposits them in his bank.
                <br><br>
                <b>Multiple collection :</b> After a collection, if the previous
                pit also have 2 or 3 seeds, they are collected and so on.
                <br><br>
                <b>Granary :</b> A pit with 11 seeds or more is called a granary.
                When a granary is played the initial pit is skipped and remains 
                empty.
